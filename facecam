Q: why stop facecamming?
i randomly decided to stop doing it one stream and realized it gave me a non-trivial mental tax/burden keeping it on. i wasn't shy, but it does have a "weight" to it, you're constantly aware the camera is on, and it has a mental burden. when off, i felt like i could think a lot clearer and feel more "natural" as if i wasn't streaming. so i'll probably stay facecam off for a while.
