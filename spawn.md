# huh?

what if - when you die and respawn, you can spawn on your teammate?

whoever you are spectating when you respawn becomes your spawn point and you teleport to their location. (but they also need to be presently alive at the moment you respawn)

# how to use plugin

when you are dead you can use a button bound to `+attack3` (default: middle mouse) to toggle spawn on teammate enabled or disabled.

alternatively you can type into chat `/tms_on` or `/tms_off` or `/tms_tog`

`/tms_help` for help
