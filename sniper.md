le sniper experiment

# what is it?
"what if we delete sniper?"

i want to play through a bunch of maps, first with sniper then without. 

# the general plan:

play through a bunch of maps with and without sniper over a few days to get a good sample of data.

ie - badwater with sniper, badwater without sniper, then another map with sniper, without sniper. do this for all the maps in the list, then repeat over 3-4 days to have multiple samples per map. 

(why are you playing so many times? i want to try look at this scientifically so i gathered some stat analysis tools to see a given classes' average kd, etc etc and maybe comparing before and after will have some interesting results. but then you'd need a decent sample size hence playing each map 3-4 times etc)

# what are the maps?

* badwater
* upward
* borneo
* swiftwater
* harvest
* lakeside

first 2 picked due to sheer popularity, rest were picked for being notoriously sniper heavy maps

(why don't you play more maps? because there's a limited amount of time in a day. this seems to be a pretty solid list to balance logistics with test thoroughness)

# when happen?

26th May + 3 ish days
