# what is the buster experiment?
essentially, spawning sentry busters as a (incredibly heavily handed) balancing mechanic. with the time alotted to blue to attack the next point, if blue takes too long it will automatically spawn sentry busters at them. if blue goes TOO fast, it spawns busters on them.

(ty to mikusch/CBaseNPC-SentryBuster, who's code i stole to make this)
