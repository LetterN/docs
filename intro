map improvement project:

why -
a while ago i started to get sick of the stock maps and wasn't enjoying valve casual anymore. i wanted better maps. i started a public tf2 server and ran custom workshop maps, but i ended up realizing that the custom maps weren't really much better either, and i was basically trading one type of pain for another kind of pain. so this is the last stop on this line of logic - to simply edit and improve the maps myself.

no i'm not taking input on what maps to improve. you don't need to tell me to fix cp junction.

some maps like hoodoo and goldrush i didn't touch because i'd have to almost remake entire sections of the map to salvage. i _might_ do it if people are really craving more stock_improved maps but prob not? idk. i'll see how people react
