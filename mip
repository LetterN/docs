map improvement project:

why -
a while ago i started to get sick of the stock maps and wasn't enjoying valve casual anymore. i wanted better maps. i started a public tf2 server and ran custom workshop maps, but i ended up realizing that the custom maps weren't really much better either, and i was basically trading one type of pain for another kind of pain. so this is the last stop on this line of logic - to simply edit and improve the maps myself.

i am taking an interative approach, so when you join the server, we might really just play point 1 of a map 6 times in a row or something. that's just how it is. if you don't like that, go play somewhere else. map improvement will likely span multiple streams and weeks, don't expect things to be done quickly.

i have some help in a discord call with me, they are FlipFTW who i talk to about map theory, and hoffer/"tessie spotter" about how to use hammer. 

i am planning to edit badwater first, then work on the other popular payload maps after that. as of writing (29th oct 2022), i'm guessing i'll make 2-3, make a video about the process and all that, get people to populate the server and then work on more maps over time?

no i'm not taking input on what maps to improve. you don't need to tell me to fix cp junction.
